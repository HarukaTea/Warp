```lua [Server]
-- Server
-- Let's make the event have ratelimit with max 50 entrance for 2 seconds.
local Remote = Warp.Server("Remote1", {
	rateLimit = {
		maxEntrance = 50, -- maximum 50 fires.
		interval = 2, -- 2 seconds
	}
})
-- Now the Event RateLimit is configured, and ready to use.
-- No need anything to adds on client side.
```

```lua [Client]
-- Client
local Remote = Warp.Client("Remote1") -- Yields, retreive rateLimit configuration.
-- The Event will automatic it self for retreiving the rate limit configuration from the server.
